# Creating a script to automate LVM in LINUX
Here I use Centos 8/Rhel 8

### LVM is Logical Volume Mangement:

Logical Volume(LV) is dynamic, i.e. it can be increased or decreased in size as and when required , thus making an efficient use of storage.
 This script when run will prompt you to use existing Volume Groups(VG) and Logical Volumes(LV) OR also to create new ones. Just download or copy and run it in python environment.
